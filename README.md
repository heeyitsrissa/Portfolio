# Portfolio

## Description
For this challenge we were asked to recreate our portfolios using react, and to deploy using Netlify.

## Installation
For creating this portfolio I started by creating the narbar component along with the app.jsx and the main.jsx. Next I created the pages folder and created the contact, about, portfolio, resume, and error pages and made sure that the links were correctly pathed on the main.jsx. Next I created the portfolio card component and integrated it into the portfolio page. Lastly I created a footer and completed all the styling.

## Usage 
This app will be a great way to showcase our work to potential employers and also will be nice to have one place to have all our work.
